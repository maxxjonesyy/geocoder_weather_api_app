**HOW DO I USE IT?**
<br>
<br>
Simply download the REPO and you will just need to get an API key from Mapbox and one from OpenweatherMaps, insert them into the variables at the top of the script.js file as shown and commented in the code here:

And away you go, you should have a fully functional Geocoder that displays the weather info!

**WHAT DID I USE TO CREATE THIS?**

A super small web app i made to improve my ability working with API's - this one in particular combines the Mapbox map API, Mapbox Geocoder functionality and the WeatherMaps API.

**HOW IT WORKS**

The user searches for a location as you would in any other navigation app, it then pinpoints this on the map using longitude and latitude values (Geocoding) which passes the WeatherMaps API these longitude and latitude values. From here the Weather info is fetched and attached to the marker placed on the map.

This project was definitely different compared to others things i've built and i was faced with new challenges which were both exciting and rewarding to overcome.
